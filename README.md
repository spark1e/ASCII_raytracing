Description: program demonstrates primitive raytracing. All graphics is drawn by ASCII characters that are
sorted by color density. In the first iterations of developing this program 2D rotating sphere was used as
a model. Linear algebra for vectors is used to determine intersections of viewpoint rays with sphere and 
plane objects on the stage. Reflections of rays are also demonstrated in this program: being reflected 
from the sphere, ray reflects from the plane. Maximum reflection number for this program is 3.
